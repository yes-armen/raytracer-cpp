# Raytracer
In this task, you will write a toy raytracer that can render the simplest scenes.
The main part of the task will be described in the seminar, here are details that were not included in the record plus a brief summary of what was told. The presentation from the seminar is in the task files.
To submit this homework, you must also submit 3 auxiliary tasks:

* [raytracer-geom](../raytracer-geom)
* [raytracer-reader](../raytracer-reader)
* [raytracer-debug](../raytracer-debug)

When submitting this task, you don't have to copy the code from the auxiliary tasks --- it will be available using includes both during local development and in the testing system. 
To make this work, use the `#include <header.h>` syntax for includes.

Here you need to implement the function
```
Image Render(const std::string& filename, const CameraOptions& camera_options, const RenderOptions& render_options);
```
Unlike `raytracer-debug`, this task uses `RenderMode::kFull`.

This function must be implemented in the `raytracer.h` file. Please note that in addition to this you can create arbitrary number of `.h` files to implement. 
They will all be sent to the server.

### Setting up the environment

On ubuntu install the following libraries:
```
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev libpng-dev
```
For Mac:
```
brew install libpng libjpeg
```
### Tests

Each test is a comparison of the result of your rendering and the author’s on the same input data. Please note that in each test you can add an additional argument to CheckImage - the path to the .png file where it will be
The result of your render is recorded. You can change the file with tests as you like - it is not sent to the server.

You can also use filters to run only the test you need. For example

`./test_raytracer "Box with spheres"`

Due to the structure of the tests, some may be tempted to read the author's answer and pass it off as their own. Authors such “decisions” will be unsuccessful. for the entire course.

### Lighting
The illumination at point $`p`$ of some object is given by the formula

``` math
I_p = I_{base}(p) + I_{comp}(p),
```

where

``` math
I_{base}(p) = K_a + K_e + al_0 \sum_{m \in lights} (K_d I_d(p, m) + K_s I_s(p, m))
```

The sum is taken over all light sources that are visible from point $`p`$ (all objects are considered opaque when checking for visibility). $`I_d`$ and $`I_s`$
these are, respectively, the diffuse and specular lighting components from the Phong model ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_reflection_model ).

$`I_{comp}`$ is calculated like this:

```math
I_{comp}(p) = al_1 I_{reflect}(p) + al_2 I_{refract}(p)
```
Here $`I_{refract}(p)`$ is the illumination from the ray refracted at point $`p`$, and $`I_{reflect}(p)`$ is the illumination
reflected in the $`p`$ beam. Note that the reflected ray does not need to be counted if the a ray inside an object (in our case, if a refracted ray is traced inside a translucent sphere).

### Postprocessing

#### Tone Mapping
When rendering is complete, and for each point the triple $v = (r, g, b)$ is known, a series of actions need to be performed.
The main problem is that these values ​​can be greater than 1, and to save the image you need to have values ​​in the range [0,1] .
The procedure for bringing these values ​​into the range [0,1] is usually called [tone mapping]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_mapping ), and in our task it needs to be done as follows
way:
* Let the largest value among all (r, g, b) over all points of the image be equal to C (this is a scalar, i.e. the maximum is taken over the triplets themselves).
* Then the vector $`V_{in} = (r, g, b)`$ must be converted into the output $`V_{out}`$ according to the rule (all operations are performed element-by-element)

``` math
V_{out} = \dfrac{V_{in}\left(1 + \dfrac{V_{in}}{C^2}\right)}{1 + V_{in}}
```

#### Gamma correction

Now that all values ​​are in the range [0,1] the last step remains to be taken. All rendering calculations were performed in linear RGB,
but when saving images, linear RGB is almost never used, because in this case, you need to allocate more than 8 bits per channel (for example
have values ​​in the range `[0, 2^16)`) to make the image look normal. Let the value of $`V_{out}`$ be obtained from the previous step.
Then you need to write in the final image

``` math
V_{gamma} = V_{out}^{\frac{1}{2.2}}
```

Please note that the Image class, through which images are written, expects rgb integers, i.e. the resulting $`V_{gamma}`$ is needed
multiply by 255 and convert to whole numbers.
